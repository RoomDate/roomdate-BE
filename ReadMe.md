<h3 align="center">Room Date is a <strong>Human</strong> focused app designed to connect people by lifestyle and region.</h3>

<h6 align= "left">We use detailed information provided by users to match them with potential housemates in their chosen region. 
Historically, finding housemates online has been impersonal and clumsy, often leaving much to be desired. 
Room Date aims to eliminate those awkward interactions by helping you match with people based on shared interests or values.
Using a dating app styled UI it's easy to swipe through our database and find potential roomies with a familiar UX.
